[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Telegram-%40Scoop-blue">](https://t.me/Scoop_it_Bot) ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue)  ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)


This repository contains the source code of a minimalistic telegram bot for managing the user's personal tasks. The goal of the project was to create an understandable and uncomplicated service inside Telegram (which for many users is the #1 application in terms of time spent daily), which would not be functionally inferior to well-known analogues from large corporations.
